"""PRE-SHIP QUALITY GATE — nothing reaches Mohamed's judge lane without passing.

Born 2026-06-14: he rated the batch "all so bad" — the system had NO gate measuring
occasion-correctness or cultural fit, so the misses shipped to his eye: ruling-royal-family
on National Day, Easter-style eggs as "Saudi Eid", a Hajj/Tawaf sacred-worship sales hook,
weak captions. His taste was the ONLY gate. This makes the gate code.

Two layers:
  DETERMINISTIC (here): HARD KILLS (royal-family casting · sacred-worship sales hook ·
    imported new-culture · brand red-lines · worn phrases) + OCCASION-FIT (caption/idea must
    touch the occasion's real themes, occasion_facts.json) + FORMAT (jurisha=cloud_kitchen).
  LLM JUDGE (separate workflow): coherence (caption↔occasion↔idea↔visual) + gold-level taste.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/pre_ship_gate.py --handle eatjurisha          # gate the corpus, print stats
  python3 scripts/pre_ship_gate.py --all --json out.json        # gate 3 pilots → candidate pool
